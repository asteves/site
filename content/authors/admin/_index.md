I am a Data Scientist at the [US Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) and a PhD Student in the [Travers Department of Political Science at UC Berkeley](https://www.polisci.berkeley.edu). My primary research interests are policing, the effects of discrimination, and causal inference.  

Outside of my academic interests, I am the creator and maintainer of the [tayloRswift](https://asteves.github.io/tayloRswift/) and am a long-suffering Minnesota sports fan.
