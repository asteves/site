I am a PhD Student in the [Travers Department of Political Science at UC Berkeley](https://www.polsci.berkeley.edu). My primary research interests are military organizations, the determinants of political violence, non-state actors, and causal inference. I am also interested in creating tools to make software easier to use for non-technical political scientists.
